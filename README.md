This menu bar app displays your current information for one or more Litecoin (and possibly Bitcoin) mining pools.

## Installation
Youâ€™ll need to build in xcode. You can set your mining pool api urls in the `PoolSummary-info.plist`, key `Pools`.

This has only been testing on wemineltc.com and give-me-ltc.com, but I'm pretty sure most mining pools all run the same base software, and will have a standard api.
